2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications,
    or as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions alone or its Combination with Covered Software, or
    any part thereof.

2.2. Conditions

Modifications

You are free to choose any license term for Your modifications to
Covered Software. You may also offer to distribute Covered Software
under other license terms, provided that:

(a) the license terms for Your modifications clearly designate them
    as Modifications made by You;

(b) the license terms of the Covered Software clearly state that
    Source Code Form of the Covered Software is made available under
    the terms of this License; and

(c) You must meet the conditions of Section 2.2(b) with respect to
    the Source Code Form of the Covered Software.

Any new file that contains any part of the Covered Software must
include the following Notice in a prominent location within the file:

    Copyright (c) 2024 HardwareMonitorWinUI3 Contributors
    
    This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
    License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
    file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If the file is Source Code Form, add the preceding Notice to the
beginning of the file and include the entire License in the first
file's comment. If a file is not Source Code Form, add the Notice to
an appropriate place in the file list (e.g., in a separate file named
NOTICE.txt).

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
reproduction, or distribution of Your Modifications, or for any such
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
distribution of the Covered Software otherwise complies with the
conditions stated in this License.

3. Submission of Contributions
-----------------------------

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the Covered Software by You shall be under
the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
terms or conditions.

4. Disclaimer of Warranty
--------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of
any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any
Covered Software is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.

5. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable
to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This
limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

6. Reporting
-----------

Each Contributor agrees that it shall have no right to set up any
funding mechanisms, whether by pledge, sponsorship, or otherwise,
for the Covered Software or for any Derivative Works thereof, and
each Contributor acknowledges that it shall have no right to receive
any royalty for any use of the Covered Software or any Derivative
Works thereof, except as expressly provided herein.

You agree to submit any claim (excluding defense and indemnification)
arising from any claim that Your Contributions infringe any patent,
copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property
right of any third party.

You agree that the terms of this License shall take precedence over
any other conflicting term in any agreement between You and a third
party.

7. Derivative Works
-------------------

You may create and distribute a Larger Work that combines Covered
Software with other material, in a separate file or files, that is
not Covered Software, subject to all the following conditions:

(a) You must give all other recipients of the Covered Software a copy
    of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source Code Form of any Derivative Works
    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
    attribution notices from the Source Code Form of the Covered
    Software You distribute, excluding those notices that do not pertain
    to any part of the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Covered Software includes a NOTICE file in a directory
    within the distribution of the Covered Software, the Derivative
    Works must include a copy of the notices in the NOTICE file,
    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
    Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
    within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative
    Works; within the Source Code or documentation, if provided along
    with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices
    normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
    informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
    may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
    You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
    the Covered Software, provided that such additional attribution
    notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
add additional terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your Modifications, or for any such Derivative Works
as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the
Covered Software otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
this License.

8. Termination
--------------

8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with any term or condition of
this License or do not take reasonable steps to cure such breach
within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

8.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a
patent infringement claim (or cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which the
contribution was contributed, constitutes direct or contributory
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under
this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability
---------------------------------------------

While redistributing the Covered Software or Derivative Works thereof,
You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
by reason of Your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

10. Miscellaneous
-----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which
provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against
the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a
Contributor.

11. Versions of the License
---------------------------

11.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number.

11.2. Effect of New Versions

Covered Software may be distributed under different versions of this
License. If You have chosen to use a particular version of this
License, the initial Contributor may add its name to the NOTICE file
in each new version of the Covered Software distributed, and You may
add Your own copyright statement to Your version.

11.3. Deprecated Versions

If You link or combine Covered Software with other material (the
"Other Material") in a file or files separate from the Covered
Software, You must provide prominent notice in a file or files in
the Other Material stating that (a) the Other Material contains
material that is subject to MPL version 2.0, and (b) You must cause
the Other Material, but not the Covered Software, to be marked with
the notice in the NOTICE file of the Covered Software, as specified
in Section 3.4, and You must include the notice in a location where
users of the Other Material can find it easily.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
distribution of the Covered Software otherwise complies with the
conditions stated in this License.

12. Information about third party components
